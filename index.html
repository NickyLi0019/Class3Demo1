      My website is a shifting house next to a river of knowledge. What could
      yours be?

    <h2>What is a website?</h2>
    <p id="1">
      A website is a collection of web pages that are linked together and stored
      on a web server.
    </p>
    <p>
      I teach within art departments at universities, so we learn about the
      internet’s impact on art—and vice versa—and how technological advance
      often coincides with artistic development. In class, we make websites. To
      do this, we learn the elemental markup and code languages of the web—HTML,
      CSS, and some JavaScript.
    </p>

      However, sometimes after the semester is over, I receive perplexing emails
      from students asking, “So how do I actually make a website?”
    </p>
    <p>
      This sparked my own questioning. “What is a website, anyway?” It’s easy to
      forget. Today there are millions of ways to make a website, and the
      abundance is daunting. But at its core, a website is still the same as
      ever before:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      A website is a file or bundle of files living on a server somewhere. A
      server is a computer that’s always connected to the internet, so that when
      someone types your URL in, the server will offer up your website. Usually
      you have to pay for a server. You also have to pay for a domain name,
      which is an understandable piece of language that points to an IP. An IP
      is a string of numbers that is an address to your server.
